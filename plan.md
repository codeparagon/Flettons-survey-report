# Sidebar Enhancement Plan

## Goals

- Reinstate the custom survey sidebar and filters after the git pull overwrite.
- Keep navigation labels and collapse/open controls matching the approved design.
- Embed filters inside the sidebar with compact styling and themed scrollbar.

## Status

- Previous customization was overwritten; sidebar currently shows original layout without collapsible filters or themed controls.
- Need to recreate navigation copy, filter toggle, CSS styling, and JS behaviour.

## Immediate Tasks

1. Restore sidebar Blade markup with new navigation items, filter toggle, and footer collapse button.
2. Reinstate survey theme CSS for sidebar layout, floating reopen button, collapsible filters, and scrollbar styling.
3. Restore survey index JS to handle sidebar collapse, filter toggle, and reset logic.
4. Verify filters render correctly and sidebar behaves as before.
